## ✅ Project Title:  
**AgroCore – The Smart Farming Intelligence Hub**

---

## ✅ Problem Statement:

Modern-day farmers face challenges due to unpredictable weather, pest outbreaks, and complex crop care routines. Most existing solutions provide fragmented insights with little automation or real-time adaptability.

**AgroCore** addresses this by creating a unified, real-time dashboard that:

- Automatically generates and updates farming tasks based on crop selection and lifecycle.
- Integrates weather data, pest risks, and inventory management.
- Offers soil nutrient predictions based on past crop history and soil type (without requiring lab-based NPK values).
- Provides intuitive visualization and automation to help farmers make better decisions without needing technical expertise.

---

## ✅ Tech Stack:

**Frontend:**
- `React.js` – Modern, component-based UI
- `3D.js` – For interactive visual elements
- `Tailwind CSS` – Fast, clean, and responsive styling

**Backend:**
- `Java (Spring Boot)` or `Python (Flask/FastAPI)` – Business logic and crop-pest-weather intelligence
- `SQLite` – Lightweight, local-friendly database

**APIs & Tools:**
- OpenWeatherMap or Weatherstack API – Real-time weather integration
- Custom rule engines for crop-stage automation, pest mapping, and nutrient estimation

## ✅ Setup Instructions:

### 1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/AgroCore.git
cd AgroCore


2. Frontend Setup:
cd client
npm install
npm start

Ensure you have Node.js ≥ v16 installed.

3. Backend Setup (Java - Spring Boot):
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run

Java 17+ is recommended.
OR
Backend Setup (Python - FastAPI):
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload


4. Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in both client and backend directories for:

WEATHER_API_KEY
DATABASE_URL
Other config-specific credentials
